# King-Arthur's-palace
A project in programming week in 2018/10.</br>
IDE: Visual Studio 2017</br>
Core Algorithm: Dijstra Algorithm and Enumeration Method</br>
Brief: The king and knights have different ways to move, which are sprinkled throughout the 8Ã—8 chessboard. </br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Users can set the number of knights, and then input the coordinates of the king and knights.</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that you will get the shortest path from every origins to the assembly point.
